PPKomp is an individual contest.
Meaning that a contestant is not allowed to discuss on the problems and solutions with other participants while the contest runs.

A contestant is allowed to refer to their text book, note book or other websites (can google or refer to online tutorial).

Even though it is an individual contest, each participant must be registered in a team.
The 5 best contestants from each team will automatically represent their team to determine for the best team award.
The marks of the 5 participants will be added as their teamâ€™s score and the team with the highest score wins.

The judge will use the score obtained on each question to detect cases of copying or discussions among participants.
If there are several participants who have the same score for all six questions, these participants will be suspected of discussing, cheating, or copying, except for participants who have a total score of 0.

The judges will then review the submitted codes of each involved participant and compare their submission.
The answers of participants found to be discussing, cheating, or copying will be invalidated, and they will be given a score of 0.

Given a list of scores obtained by all participants from the same group.
You are to calculate the scores of each participant from that group and identify if there are students suspected of discussing, cheating, or copying.
